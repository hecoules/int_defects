% DESCRIPTION
int_defects is a toolbox for MATLAB designed to help engineers investigate the interactions between co-planar crack-like flaws in structures. It uses the Abaqus Finite Element Analysis (FEA) package to create and solve models of single flaws and pairs of flaws in plates and pipes of finite thickness. The results can be used to predict the initiation of fracture or plastic collapse. int_defects allows large parametric series of models of interacting cracks to be generated and solved automatically. It also contains functions for automatic post-processing, calculation of interaction factors and plotting of the results. int_defects is free and open-source software distributed under the terms of the MIT license.

% USER GUIDE
The User Guide included in this distribution (int_defects User Guide.pdf) gives further details of the software package, including its range of applications, instructions for installation and pre-requisite software.

% ARTICLE
This toolbox and some of the associated examples are described in the following article:
